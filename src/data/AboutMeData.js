I'm a life-long learner who's never stopped feeding his intellect.", "I also started my professional career young. Working since I was eleven years old I have a robust work ethic, and have held many jobs. At one time I held down three jobs at the same time. (What was I thinking!?)", "My passion for life has taken me across small towns and big cities, the natural beauty of Yosemite to the vibrant and modern architecture of the San Diego skyline.
